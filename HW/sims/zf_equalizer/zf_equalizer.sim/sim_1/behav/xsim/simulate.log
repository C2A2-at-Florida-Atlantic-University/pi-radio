Info: [XPM_MEMORY 20-1] MEMORY_PRIMITIVE (0) instructs Vivado Synthesis to choose the memory primitive type. Depending on their values, other XPM_MEMORY parameters may preclude the choice of certain memory primitive types. Review XPM_MEMORY documentation and parameter values to understand any limitations, or set MEMORY_PRIMITIVE to a different value. zf_equalizer_tb.DUT.zf_equalizer_i.Normalized_ZF_stage_1.axis_data_fifo_0.inst.\gen_fifo.xpm_fifo_axis_inst .xpm_fifo_base_inst.\gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst .config_drc
